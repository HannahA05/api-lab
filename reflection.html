                Using GitHub Copilot really helped me get this lab done faster. I used prompts like “Create a simple HTML page that uses Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js to display a grid of dog images from an API” and “Write an Alpine.js component that fetches 12 random dog images from the Dog CEO API with loading, error handling, and a breed selector.” Copilot gave me working code almost right away, and I mostly just had to tweak it a little. I noticed GPT-4o gave better, more complete answers than the other model. Overall, it made building the page a lot easier and saved me from writing all the code from scratch.
